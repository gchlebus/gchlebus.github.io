I'm a Senior Applied Scientist at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/uk/?rid=ip&prevsite=en&newsite=uk&geo=DE&geomatch=uk) and a Scientist Medical Image Analysis at [Fraunhofer MEVIS](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/).
I'm interested in practical applications of ML/AI methods with particular interest in image segmentation, time series modelling and uncertainty quantification.
