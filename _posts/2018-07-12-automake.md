**automake** is a Python script which executes **make** automatically every time any of
the source files listed in the Makefile change. Installation and usage instructions can be
found in my [github repository](https://github.com/gchlebus/automake). I hope that you
would find **automake** useful and would love to hear in the comments about your use
cases.


### My use case

I use **automake** to get automatic previews of documents written in LaTeX. This is
particularly helpful when trying to create a plot with just right font sizes, line widths,
etc. Normally, such figures are included as separate files via the `\includegraphics`
command. Most LaTeX editing environments or tools fail to detect changes of such files.
Thus, every time you create a new version of a figure, you need to trigger the compilation
process manually. is not the case with **automake** when you specify the figure files or
the directory containing them as prerequisites of the make target.  Here is an example
Makefile I used to write one paper.

```
BASENAME=paper

all : ${BASENAME}.tex ${BASENAME}.bib figures plots
      latexmk -pdf -bibtex ${BASENAME}.tex
```

Because the directories *figures* and *plots*, which I used to store my images, were
specified as prerequisites of the `all` target, **automake** was calling **make** every
time I saved a new file into these directories.

#### PDF viewer

The last thing required is a pdf viewer, which can refresh the opened file every time the
file changes. I personally like using [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io).
